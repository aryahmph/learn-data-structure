> Big-O notation is a way of converting the overall steps of an algorithm into algebraic terms, then excluding lower order constants and coefficients that donâ€™t have that big an impact on the overall complexity of the problem.

In plain words, Big O notation describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms. Big O is also divided into
two, namely time complexity and space complexity.

There are several kinds of Big O complexity, including:

## 1. Constant or Big O(1)

## 2. Linear or Big O(n)

See example code [here](src/main/java/aryahmph/BigOImpl.java).

```java
public class BigOImpl implements BigO {
    public void linear(int[] array) {
        // O(n) time
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            // Constant time
            System.out.println("Step : " + i + 1);
            System.out.println("Step : " + i + 1);
            System.out.println("Step : " + i + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

The above function has the time complexity O(n), because it will do as many commands as n.
